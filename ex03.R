# The independent sample t-test was conducted to compare the flipper lengths  
# of male and female Adelie penguins. The mean flipper length for females was  
# 187.79 mm (SD = 5.60 mm), while for males it was 192.41 mm (SD = 6.60 mm).  
# Levene’s test showed no significant difference in variances (p = 0.156), so  
# a Student’s t-test was used. The t-test result (t = -4.56, df = 140.25,  
# p = 1.11e-05) indicates a significant difference in flipper length between  
# sexes. Since male flippers were longer, we conclude that male Adelie  
# penguins have significantly longer flippers than females (p < 0.001).
